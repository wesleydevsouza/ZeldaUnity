# 🗡️ Adventure Game (Unity Study Project)

This is an **adventure game prototype** inspired by classic titles like **The Legend of Zelda**, developed using **Unity** as part of a learning journey through a **Udemy course**.

The goal of this project was to deepen my understanding of essential game development systems in Unity, including:

### 🎮 Key Features:

* **Player movement and attack controls**
* **Collision detection** for walls, enemies, and interactive elements
* **Damage and health systems**
* **Dynamic camera** following the player with smooth transitions
* **Tilemaps and 2D world building**
* Integration of **free and paid assets** from the Unity Asset Store
* Scene management and basic state control

### 📚 Learning Focus:

* Handling Unity’s 2D physics and animation systems
* Implementing modular gameplay logic via scripts
* Exploring Unity’s asset pipeline and resource management
* Building reusable gameplay systems like combat, camera, and interactions

> 🎓 This project was created **for educational purposes only**, and is not intended as a commercial release.
